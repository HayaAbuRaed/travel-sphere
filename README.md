# TravelSphere - Travel and Accommodation Booking Platform

TravelSphere is a travel and accommodation booking platform that allows users to search for and book hotels. Moreover, it allows admins to manage the different aspects of the platform. <br />

**This project is built as the final project of my front-end internship at Foothill Technology Solutions.**

## üíª Design patterns

This project leverages several design patterns to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase. Below are some key patterns implemented:

### 1. Provider Pattern

The Provider Pattern is used extensively across the project to manage and pass down global state and contextual data. For example, in the `HotelCard` component, `HotelCardContext` is used to provide hotel data to its child components without prop drilling.

### 2. Compound Components Pattern

The Compound Components Pattern allows related components to be grouped together as part of a single parent component. This pattern is implemented in components like `HotelCard`, where subcomponents such as `DiscountChip`, `InfoCard`, `Heading`, `Description`, `Rating`, and `PriceSegment` are attached directly to the `HotelCard` component. This provides flexibility in composing UI elements. Here is an article that I find helpful in understanding the Compound Components Pattern: [Compound components - React](https://dev.to/bqardi/compound-components-react-1ag8).

### 3. Context API

The Context API is utilized throughout the project to share data and functions across components without having to pass props manually. This is especially useful in managing state and actions related to authentication, user preferences, and theming.

### 4. Custom Hooks

Custom React hooks are created to encapsulate reusable logic across the application. For example, custom hooks are used for data fetching with React Query like `useGetHotel` in `src/pages/Hotel/hooks` , form validation with Formik like `useAddHotelForm` in `src\pages\HotelsManagement\hooks`, and handling user authentication.

### 5. Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are used to extend the functionality of existing components by wrapping them with additional logic. In this project, the `routeHOC` is utilized to handle access control based on user roles and dynamically set the document title for different pages. This pattern allows for the injection of role-based access checks and other enhancements, ensuring that only authorized users can view specific pages while maintaining a clean and modular codebase.

### 6. Container-Presenter Pattern

This pattern is used to separate the logic and data fetching responsibilities (Container) from the UI rendering responsibilities (Presenter). This helps in keeping the components clean, focused, and easier to test.
